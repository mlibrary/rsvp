## Ruby SIP Validation and Processing

## Overview

At its core RSVP manages a workflow of discrete stages for validating and
converting SIP shipments and their associated image files for
University of Michigan DCU.

## Installation

### 1. Set up development

The minimum Ruby version is 2.7.4.

```
mkdir -p vendor/bundle
bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
bundle install
```

For basic functionality when running outside Docker, the following packages
should be installed via Homebrew if running on Mac OS:
```
exiftool
libtiff
netpbm
```

RSVP uses Kakadu for JPEG2000 compression. For local use, the free version
should suffice for development purposes.


### 2. Set up Docker development

```
$ docker-compose build
```

### 3. Running tests

```
$ docker-compose run --rm test
$ docker-compose run --rm test bundle exec rubocop
```

or

```
$ bundle exec rake test
$ bundle exec rubocop
```
